OS takes physical resource and virtualize them. Meanwhile, it deals with concurrency and persistence issue arises as a consequence.
## program
processor fetches instruction from memory, decodes it, executes it, move on to the next instruction
## virturalization
OS takes a physical resource and transforms it into a more general, powerful, and easy-to-use virtual form. We interact with such virtiual form of resource via system calls
## virtual memory
each process has its own virtual address space all for itself
