# AWS access control
AWS uses IAM web service to control access permissions of servcies and accounts
## IAM users
- username and password to sign in
## IAM groups
- a collection of users
## IAM roles
- unlike users, roles are not an account you could sign in
- based on trust policy, it is dynamically applied to a set of accounts and services and defines what they can access
## IAM policy
defines access permissions
